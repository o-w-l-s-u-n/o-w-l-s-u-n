Greetings,

I am currently seeking new opportunities in frontend/fullstack web development, with a focus on building web applications utilizing React. In addition to my current skill set, I am expanding my knowledge by learning Golang, information security and blockchain development.

I am in search of a high-quality, engaging role that will challenge me and facilitate the growth of my skills. If you are aware of any such opportunities or have any advice, I would appreciate your input.

Feel free to inquire about my previous work experience, my preferred programming languages, or any questions you may have about development or security.

You can contact me via email at magerk38@gmail.com or connect with me on ![https://t.me/owlsun](Telegram).
